The key to success of the proof is that the receiver inputs hish choices before the sender inputs her messages $m_0$ and $m_1$. By doing this it allows to differentiate the function f of the one-out-of-two protocol and those from Lo’s no-go theory. This led to the development of other QOT protocols that are not constrained by Lo's theorem, expanding the possibilities for secure quantum communication in cryptography.\n",
