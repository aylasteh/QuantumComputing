The key to the success of the proof is that the receiver inputs their choices before the sender inputs her messages $m_0$ and $m_1$. By doing this, it allows for differentiation between the function *f* of the one-out-of-two protocol and those from Lo’s no-go theory. This led to the development of other QOT protocols that are not constrained by Lo's theorem, thereby expanding the possibilities for secure quantum communication in cryptography.\n",

    "1. <b>Innovative Design</b>:\n",
    "   - The protocol is the first one-out-of-two Quantum Oblivious Transfer (QOT) protocol designed directly based on quantum properties.\n",
    "   - It does not rely on all-or-nothing QOT and is proven secure, not subject to Lo’s no-go theorem.\n",
    "   - The protocol is simple and efficient, using single nonorthogonal qubits, and one of the two messages is discarded automatically.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "2. <b>Security</b>:\n",
    "   - The protocol effectively prevents both external and internal attacks.\n",
    "   - Loyalty testing ensures security against internal attacks by detecting a dishonest Alice or Bob using safety parameters $ξ_2$, $ξ_3$ and $ξ_4$\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "3. <b>Cost and Efficiency</b>:\n",
    "   - The protocol is more cost-effective and efficient than many traditional two-level structure protocols, utilizing <b>4x less</b> quantum resources than the other three protocols presented.\n",
    "   - It uses only a single qubit, making it easy to implement.\n",
