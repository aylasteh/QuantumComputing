    "If you only have acces to a device that prepares classical photons, if you send horizontal photons, no information is gained and you won't know if the box contains a bomb or not. So you would have to send vertical photons to find out if the box contains a bomb or not. When sending vertical photons the box will explode if it contains a bomb. You should not accept the mission, because the only way to find out if the box contains the bomb is by triggering it."

If you send a photon through a vain box, the photon will stay the same, if it passes through a box with a bomb, it will either compress to |0>, and you can measure the photon at the end, or the bomb explodes. With measuring the photon at the end you will be able to tell if a bomb is in the box, and the bomb only explodes with a probability of 50%.\n",
